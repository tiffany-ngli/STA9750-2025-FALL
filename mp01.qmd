Looking at the trend over the past years, viewership has shown a modest rise. Although there's high variability due to outliers seen in 2022. Given the global appeal of Hindi films, Netflix should broaden their accessibility, not just in India, but worldwide. The next wave of Hindi cinema could take audiences even further and continue to drive these numbers up.

### Hitting the Breaks... Can it Make a Comeback?
Although not shown in the dataset, *Formula 1: Drive to Survive: Season 1* aired back in 2019 and has since been renewed every year. However, viewership stats per season has seen a decline in the past seasons. Therefore, the question is: can season 8 surpass past seasons?
```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

# Totalling views per season
f1 <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |>
  filter(show_title %in% "Formula 1: Drive to Survive") |>
  mutate(season = str_sub(season_title,-1)) |>
  group_by(season) |>
  summarize(total_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed)/1e06) |> 
  arrange(desc(total_hours)) |> 
  glimpse()

# BAR PLOT
ggplot(f1, aes(x = season, y = total_hours)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity",fill = "slateblue") +
      labs(title = "F1: Drive to Survive Viewership per Season",
       y = "Views (in millions)",
       x = "Season") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_markdown(size = 20, face = "bold")
  )
```

### Undeniable Global Reach
F1 is one of the most globally accessible sports, broadcasted worldwide, as drivers race across the globe tackling tracks with some of the tightest turns at neck breaking speeds. For that reason, it’s no surprise that the Netflix show has reached the Top 10 in so many countries. Aside from offering a behind the scene look at the season, the sports docuseries provides detailed recaps of each race for viewers who may have missed them live due to time zone differences. 
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
COUNTRY_TOP_10 |>
  filter(show_title %in% "Formula 1: Drive to Survive") |>
  group_by(season_title) |>
  distinct(country_name) |>
  count(season_title) |>
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  format_titles() |>
  datatable(options=list(searching=FALSE, info=FALSE), colnames = c("Season", "Countries"))
```

### 💡 Marketing Solution 
* Following the well perceived *F1: The Movie* released earlier this summer, there are surely new fans attracted to the high speed sport. Press should cross promote season 8 to these new fans and introduce them to the beginner friendly Netflix's series. Not just tuning in for the new season, but catching up with older seasons to understand rivalries and history.
* With so many new rookie drivers this season, brief social media introductions would help build their personal brands while generating excitement for the new season and giving viewers a glimpse of what’s to come in their careers. 
* Collaborations between drivers and TikTok influencers or sports media would help broaden exposure and attract new viewers.
